# Tidy-Evaluation

In R, tidy evaluation is a framework used primarily within the tidyverse ecosystem (especially in packages like dplyr and ggplot2) to make it easier to work with expressions, variables, and functions in a consistent, flexible way. Tidy evaluation provides mechanisms for managing non-standard evaluation (NSE), which allows R to treat variable names as symbols rather than requiring them to be evaluated immediately. This feature is particularly useful in data manipulation and analysis, where users often want to refer to columns or variables within functions without quoting them or using complex expressions.

At the heart of tidy evaluation are two main concepts: quoting and unquoting. Quoting captures an expression (such as a variable or column name) without immediately evaluating it, allowing it to be passed through a function. Unquoting, on the other hand, allows the quoted expressions to be evaluated at a later point. This is done using the {{ and !! operators for unquoting and the rlang::enquo() function for quoting expressions.

Tidy evaluation is beneficial because it enables functions to handle variables dynamically, without requiring them to be hardcoded. For instance, within dplyr, functions like mutate() or filter() can use column names directly, thanks to tidy evaluation principles, making the code more readable and less error-prone. By allowing users to write expressive, readable, and flexible code, tidy evaluation makes data manipulation with tidyverse functions smoother and more intuitive.
